# Water Level Sensor

#### Project Overview

The Water Level Sensor project demonstrates how to monitor water levels using an Arduino Nano and a water level sensor module. Water level sensors are essential in various applications such as water tanks, aquariums, and industrial systems to ensure optimal water levels and prevent overflow or dry-running scenarios. This project allows you to detect whether the water level is above or below a specified threshold.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Water Level Sensor Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Water Level Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the analog output of the water level sensor module to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Nano.
   - Optionally, connect the power (VCC) and ground (GND) pins of the water level sensor module to the respective VCC and GND pins on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the water level sensor module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the water level readings displayed as "Water level is HIGH" or "Water level is LOW" based on the threshold value.
   - Adjust the threshold value as needed to suit the specific water level detection requirements.

#### Applications

- **Water Tank Monitoring:** Monitor water levels in tanks to prevent overflow or ensure an adequate water supply.
- **Aquarium Water Level Control:** Maintain proper water levels in aquariums to support aquatic life.
- **Industrial Automation:** Use water level sensors in industrial systems for process control and monitoring.

#### Notes

- Ensure proper calibration of the water level sensor module to accurately detect water levels.
- Adjust the threshold value based on the specific water level requirements of your application.
- Consider implementing additional features such as alarms or notifications for critical water level conditions.
